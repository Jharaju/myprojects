I am created a chat application. You can chat only with available members. If you want to give privillages to chat with anyone 
than you need to make some changes. Believe me its easy to compare with it. If you can does it than you obviously do that easily.

Before creating this application you need to create your databases and tables by yourself bacause i am using this chat application in my 
project. So i couldn't provide you the database to import it. its so easy to create database and table for developers. Isn't it?

Follow these instructions:

1. Create your database
2. Create table users for login, signup, columns names dependds on you.
3. Create table members, same col_name depends on you.
4. Create table messages, here you need to make id as foreign key of members. 2nd col is where_from(optional) you can fetch id insteadof,
   3rd is where_to(required) save to targetid in this col. , 4th col is for time(most important) you need as in derived format.
   I alrady written the code in dynamic.php. Dont worry!, And last col is for time to show inside messeges.

Thats all about database.

IN stylesheet, there have many other codes for other pages. So dont worry about that keep the codes you need.

So finally thats all about it! Thanku.
